/**
 * A WearableListenerService is only delivered the path prefixes its manifest
 * filter names. An unlisted path is not an error anywhere — the message is
 * simply dropped, on both devices, in silence.
 *
 * That cost three features before it was spotted: the colour scheme, the
 * mirrored display preferences and the toggle state were all implemented,
 * wired and tested, and none of them ever arrived. The watch's sensor-claim
 * status had been going nowhere for longer still.
 *
 * So: every path [MessageReceiver] handles must be covered by a prefix in both
 * manifests. Requiring both rather than reasoning about which side handles what
 * keeps this check honest — a listed path the device never receives costs
 * nothing, and the receiver already ignores anything meant for the other side.
 *
 * Only these two files are read, because only these two are build inputs: one source set
 * gets one manifest, and `sourceSets` in `Common/build.gradle` declares no per-variant one.
 * Seventeen `AndroidManifest.xml.*` snapshots from the initial import (`.debug`, `.release`,
 * `.33`, ...) were deleted in #496; they looked like per-variant overlays and still listed
 * `/settings`, but no manifest merger ever read them.
