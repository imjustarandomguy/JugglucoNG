/**
 * Guards the connect-mode lever and the measurement that would justify ever pulling it.
 *
 * SuperGattCallback.autoconnect is a single application-wide static that the SensorBluetooth
 * constructor overwrites from Natives.getAndroid13(); while the connectGatt call sites read it
 * directly no driver could choose its own mode, and the 2026-08-01 jamming storm accordingly
 * logged 103 connect attempts (52 + 51, two Ottai sensors) at autoConnect=true and none at false.
 * useAutoConnect() makes a per-driver choice expressible, and the 2026-09-09 CT5 trace is the
 * first measurement that decides it for one peripheral: after a lowPower frame the transmitter is
 * only connectable near its 3-minute push, and three direct connects in a row reported their first
 * callback at 30016ms, 30027ms and 30038ms — Android's connect timer expiring, status 147 — for 96
 * seconds of dead air. That is the number noteFirstGattCallback exists to collect, so the Anytime
 * driver may answer it. Issue #519 later reports recovery with fresh direct connections in classic
 * Juggluco using the same Libre 2 sensor, while NG can reuse a failed GATT. Libre 2 therefore uses
 * fresh direct attempts; other drivers keep inheriting the application-wide setting.
 * These are source scans because the classes involved need the Android runtime and the native
 * library to be constructed at all.
