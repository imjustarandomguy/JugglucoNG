/**
 * Characterisation of the two `GlucoseAlarms` implementations, before either is changed.
 *
 * This is the category S pair the plan singles out: "GlucoseAlarms sits on the alert path:
 * characterise it first and give it full review" (direction.md §4). So these tests assert
 * the *asymmetry* between the phone and the watch, not that they are equal -- the
 * asymmetries are mostly deliberate, and unifying them is a behaviour change that would
 * need a device, not a refactor.
 *
 * Source checks rather than behavioural ones, like HealthConnectNullSensorptrTests next
 * door: `handlealarm()` calls Natives, Notify, SensorBluetooth and LossOfSensorAlarm, none
 * of which a local JVM test can load or fake usefully. The decision logic itself (the
 * nexttime arithmetic and the `saidloss` latch) is identical in both and lives in
 * [SuperGlucoseAlarms] on the alarm path, so it is not restated here either.
 *
 * What this pins, phone vs watch:
 * - the watch recomputes the complication views, the phone does not;
 * - only the phone relays the loss alarm to WearInt, and only behind `doWearInt`;
 * - only the phone pushes the stale value to the home-screen widget;
 * - the phone's wake is conditional on `shouldwakesender()`, the watch's is unconditional;
 * - the watch asks for a sync afterwards, the phone only while the watch reads a sensor too;
 * - the phone calls `ensureCurrentSensorSelection()` on reconnect, the watch does not;
 * - and the one that looks like a bug rather than a decision: with no loss alarm the phone
 *   sends an `oldnotification` and the watch does nothing at all.
