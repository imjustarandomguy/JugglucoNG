/**
 * Where the island pill sits against the camera cutout, in pixels. Pure, see the tests.
 *
 * The window is docked to a screen edge and the pill is placed in it by its near side: the
 * gap from the screen edge to the pill. To centre the pill on the cutout that gap is the
 * distance to the cutout's middle less half the pill's thickness across the edge, and the
 * thickness is the pill's height when docked to the top or bottom, its width on the left or
 * right. So no one gap fits both orientations, a font size or a digit more: the layout
 * works the gap out from the measured pill, and the setting is only a nudge from there.
