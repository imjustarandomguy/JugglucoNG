/**
 * The phone's Health Connect bridge (direction.md §4, category P — "needs phone-only
 * libraries").
 *
 * `HealthConnection` is androidx.health and stays in `src/mobile`, as the recipe asks;
 * shared code used to name it from `Applic`, `MainActivity`, `SuperGattCallback` and
 * `Settings`, which is why a 12-line watch stub had to exist. The shared calls go through
 * here instead: the phone registers, the watch registers nothing, and a caller that gets
 * null skips the call (P2).
 *
 * The watch stub's bodies were empty, so skipping is what the watch already did. Every
 * shared call site is behind `!isWearable` or an SDK check anyway.
