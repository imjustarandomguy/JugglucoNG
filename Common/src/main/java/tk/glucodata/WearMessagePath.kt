/**
 * The phone-watch message paths, as one closed set.
 *
 * The wire strings are copied verbatim from the constants this replaces, so the protocol does
 * not move when these are adopted. Each name is the last path segment, upper-cased with
 * underscores: that is the rule the path constants did not follow and now do, so a name always
 * says where the message goes.
 *
 * The point of a closed type rather than a list of strings is the dispatch in `MessageReceiver` is
 * currently a `when` on a `String`, which the compiler checks for nothing -- an unhandled path
 * is a log line at runtime. On this type the `when` is checked for exhaustiveness, which is the
 * plan §6 Q2 requirement to "define what happens with an unknown message" rather than to log
 * and continue.
 *
 * [wire] stays the single place a path exists as text. `WearMessagePathManifestTests` compares
 * it against both manifests and against the receiver, so a path cannot drift without the
 * existing guard noticing.
