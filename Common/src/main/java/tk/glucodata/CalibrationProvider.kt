/**
 * The phone's calibration engine as `src/main` needs it (plan P1/Q1).
 *
 * The mobile `Specific.registerBridges` registers
 * [tk.glucodata.data.calibration.MobileCalibrationProvider]; the watch registers
 * [SyncedWearCalibrationProvider]. Before this, `CalibrationAccess` reached the
 * mobile-only `CalibrationManager` reflectively and the watch silently got the
 * defaults below, because the class is not on its classpath. The defaults here
 * are those same absent-class results, so a flavour without an engine behaves
 * exactly as it did.
 *
 * The mutation methods ([setEnabledForMode], [clearAllBlocking],
 * [deleteCalibrationAtBlocking], [updateCalibrationUserValueBlocking],
 * [addCalibrationFromWearAtBlocking]) return whether the engine actually handled
 * the call; their default `false` is the old "method not found" answer.
