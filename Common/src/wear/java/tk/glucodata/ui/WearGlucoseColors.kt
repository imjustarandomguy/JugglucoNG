/**
 * The watch's glucose colours, resolved exactly as the phone resolves them.
 *
 * The watch used to paint every reading with the five-band AGP colour — the
 * in-range hue included — so a whole screen came out green and carried no
 * information, and none of it followed the palette the user had chosen on the
 * phone. Both problems have the same fix: run the phone's own rules
 * ([GlucoseValueTone]) over the palette [tk.glucodata.GlucoseColorSync] mirrors
 * from the phone.
 *
 * The phone's scheme is:
 *  - the number stays neutral unless "colour values by range" is on, and then
 *    takes the colour set for its band;
 *  - the hero container carries a faint five-band tint when out of range;
 *  - the chart traces by band.
 *
 * Wear renders on a dark background throughout, so the dark variants apply.
