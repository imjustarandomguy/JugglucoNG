/**
 * One shared, off-main-thread copy of the history the watch screens draw from.
 *
 * Every screen used to read the store itself, on the main thread, and re-read it
 * on each refresh: the chart pulled the whole 14-day horizon on init, on every
 * range change, on every arriving sync chunk and once a minute, while the home
 * list pulled six hours of its own and each reading row asked native for the
 * calibration anchors separately. A backfill of 26 chunks therefore meant 26
 * full-horizon reads with a Room/native merge each, all blocking frames.
 *
 * Now a single loader owns it: reads are coalesced, run on a background
 * dispatcher, cover only the horizon something is actually showing, and grow
 * only when the user pans further back.
